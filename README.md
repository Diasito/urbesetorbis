## Map of the Roman Empire under Emperor Hadrian
### Cross-references to the main catalogues of Roman settlements


This is a map of the Roman Empire at the end of AD 130.

There are 7,891 settlements represented here both within the borders of the empire and beyond. All objects on the map generally correspond to two unsurpassed catalogues of ancient geography â€” [the Barrington Atlas](https://web.archive.org/web/20100530180105/http://www.unc.edu/awmc/batlas.html) and [the Pleiades project](https://pleiades.stoa.org/).

The project has two main goals. The first is to present, using modern means, an interactive map of the Roman Empire at the time of the founding of Antinoopolis. The second goal is to connect disparate scientific databases of ancient Roman settlements, collecting their IDs and hyperlinks to them in one place.

The project provides references and, where possible, hyperlinks to the following databases:

* Barrington Atlas
* Ancient World Mapping Center (UNC-Chapel Hill)
* Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations (Harvard)
* Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire (University of Gothenburg)
* Orbis (Stanford)
* Pleiades
* Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites
* Tabula Peutingeriana (Cambridge)
* ToposText
* Trismegistos
* Urban Geography of the Roman World (Hanson 2016, Oxford)
* Vici.org
* Wikidata
* Wikipedia:en

The whole project was made on OpenLayers v8, in the form of several layers from GeoJSON files. The map base, including coastline and provincial outlines, was taken mainly from [the Ancient World Mapping Center](http://awmc.unc.edu/awmc/map_data/). Numerous polygon errors were fixed. Several provincial boundaries were aligned with geographic features.

This non-profit project does not pretend to be scientific and was created for fun, but I tried to be as accurate as possible. I will gladly accept criticism and advice both on the content and on the program code. Please send your comments and suggestions.
